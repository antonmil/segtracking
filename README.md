Joint Tracking and Segmentation of Multiple Targets
===================================================

This is a framework for tracking and segmenting multiple targets.
This work is described in the following CVPR 2015 paper [(pdf)](http://www.milanton.de/files/cvpr2015/cvpr2015-anton.pdf)


    Joint Tracking and Segmentation of Multiple Targets
    A. Milan, L. Leal-Taixe, K. Schindler and I. Reid 


Installation
==============

This section describes how to get segTracking running on linux.

Get the latest version of the code and cd into that directory

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/amilan/segtracking
    cd segtracking
    

    
    
        
Running
=======

Start Matlab and run

	installSegTracker;
	
Now all should be set up. You can start the tracker with.

    stateInfo = swSegTracker('config/scene.ini','config/params.ini');
    
The output should be similar to the one in logs/log_tud-campus.txt. Note that both discrete inference 
and continuous minimization may lead to slightly different final results, depending on the current 
software environment and hardware architecture.
    
    
    
Other videos
------------

To run the tracker on other videos, adjust the necessary settings in a scene file in 

    scene.ini
    
Parameters can be set in

    params.ini
